First, you need to install the compiler package.

- You need VS2012
  If you want to build the msi make sure the "Tools for Redistributing
  Applications" are installed.

Next you need to install some utilities/programs:
- TortoiseSVN or SubWCRev : http://tortoisesvn.net
- WiX(*)                  : http://wix.sourceforge.net
- NAnt(*)                 : http://nant.sourceforge.net

(*) Add the paths of the binaries to the PATH environment variable
    You may have to logoff/logon to make the new environment variables take effect!

Note: if you're not using TortoiseSVN, you have to install SubWCRev (which is part
of TortoiseSVN) anyway, but it is also available separately from here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=138498&package_id=281312


Now you're almost ready. Only a few more steps to do:
- Checkout the CryptSync sources from the Subversion repository
- Make a copy of the file default.build.user.tmpl in the CryptSync root folder and
  rename that copy to default.build.user. Then adjust the paths as mentioned
  in that file.


Building packages

  Hint: before you can start building CryptSync, you need to call the vsvars32.bat
  file which is located in %VS110COMNTOOLS%.

  > nant
  will compile CryptSync and create the msi installer

  If you encounter any build errors, you can run nant again like this:

  > nant -l:buildlog.txt

  which will create a build log file which you can use to analyse where
  exactly the build failed.


  After the script finished, the packages can be found in .\bin .

Once CryptSync has been built with the NAnt script, you can build it again
with VS2012 alone.
